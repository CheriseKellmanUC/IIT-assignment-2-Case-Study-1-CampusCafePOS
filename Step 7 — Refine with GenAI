Student Reflection:
I agree with suggestions to make my view cart function more informative and to rename my variable for student discount to improve the readability of my code. 
This does let me know I am on the right track, because when I originally wrote the code, I only had one discount in mind. I only added a meal deal to try to see if I could do the stretch activity. 
I also like the optional ideas copilot suggested at the end for the GUI and saving receipts for record keeping, however I am not there yet with my skills. I do look forward to improving though.
